# SharpControls

This is a collection of different libraries to easier work with C# based projects. If nothing further said, those libraries are for plain NET 8.0+ and should work on most frameworks running on this version of NET and for sure pure NET. Some libraries can have dependencies on frameworks like UNO Platform, but this would be said inside the library.
Many of those libraries are also a copy from the [live-controls](https://www.github.com/live-controls/) libraries for Laravel but maybe work different here.
